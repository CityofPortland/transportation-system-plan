# Modal Plans

## Introduction

Modal plans are twenty-year plans that accomplish citywide or regional breadth of study and analysis within the scope of the city’s pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and freight modes. The result includes identified projects and policies to provide a safe, reliable, healthy and affordable transportation system with travel options, as consistent with the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). Each modal plan is a stand-alone policy document, supplementing policies in the Comprehensive Plan and TSP. This chapter therefore includes summaries in reference of relevant modal plan policy documents.

## PedPDX: Portland’s Citywide Pedestrian, Plan, 2019

PedPDX is an update of the 1998 Pedestrian Master Plan. It prioritizes sidewalk and crossing improvements and other investments to make walking safer and more comfortable across the city. The plan additionally identifies key strategies and tools to make Portland a great walking city for everyone. The results of this plan inform the Pedestrian Network Completion Program and updated the TSP pedestrian districts and classifications as consistent with implementing the Comprehensive Plan.

## Enhanced Transit Corridors Plan, 2018

The Enhanced Transit Corridors Plan helps identify where transit priority, streamlining, and access treatments could be most beneficial on the planned TriMet Frequent Service network within the City of Portland. Such improvements can help make transit more attractive and reliable for people to get to work, school, and to meet their daily needs, especially for people who depend upon transit. Part of the plan includes an Enhanced Transit Toolbox. This Toolbox is a collection of potential capital and operational treatments that can be applied to improve transit performance or create safer, more predictable interactions with other travel modes.

### Safe Routes to School Project Planning, 2018

In May 2016, Portland voters passed Measure 26-173, approving a 10 -cent gas tax and Heavy Vehicle Use Tax. Expected to raise $64 million for road maintenance and street safety projects over the next four years, the Fixing Our Streets program also dedicated $8 million to make routes safer and more convenient for kids to walk, bike, and roll to school. The $8 million allocated for school improvements was not identified for specific projects. With over 100 schools throughout the city, the need for street improvements to support safe travel to school is greater than the Fixing Our Streets funds available. Fixing Our Streets tasked Safe Routes to School to find out what changes Portlanders would like to see around their schools and develop a process to target and prioritize safety investments.

### Southwest Corridor Plan, 2018

A key part of the Southwest Corridor Plan is a proposed 12-mile MAX light rail line from downtown Portland to Tigard and Bridgeport Village in Tualatin, along with numerous walking, biking and roadway projects to help people access stations. This plan was created as a partnership of seven cities, Washington County and the Metro Council, along with TriMet and the Oregon Department of Transportation.

The Southwest Corridor Plan includes:
- A new 12-mile MAX line from downtown Portland to Tigard and Bridgeport Village in Tualatin;
- Roadway, bicycle and pedestrian projects to help people get to transit;
- A strategy to promote equitable development in the corridor when light rail is constructed;
- A specific equitable housing strategy for Tigard and Portland along the light rail line;
- A Shared Investment Strategy for transportation improvements that connect the corridor’s communities well beyond the proposed light rail line.

### Growing Transit Communities Plan, 2017

The Growing Transit Communities Plan identified and prioritized the most beneficial improvements to make getting to the bus and using the bus, a safer and more convenient option along sections of three bus lines 87, 77, and 20 that served as typologies for citywide comparison. The plan determined a package of transportation investments on a corridor level that would best create transit-oriented neighborhoods, places where transit (along with walking and bicycling for short trips) is truly the mode of choice for getting to and from work, school, shops, or other destinations.

### Regional Over-Dimensional Truck Route Study, 2016

This study was undertaken to better understand how over-dimensional truck freight travels in the tri-county region of Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties. The study identified key routes, challenges, and a range of potential solutions to improve and protect the transportation network for over-dimensional trucks. Recommendations updated the TSP freight classifications and projects list.

### Vision Zero Action Plan, 2016

The Vision Zero Action Plan is Portland’s commitment to ending traffic violence by eliminating deaths and serious injuries on Portland streets. Portland City Council passed a resolution adopting Vision Zero in June 2015. This set in motion a planning effort that created the Vision Zero Action Plan.

### Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030, 2011

The Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030 includes a list of capital projects and recommended actions. It recommends strengthening city policies in support of bicycling, providing more and better bicycle parking, expanding educational and encouragement programs and developing ongoing measures of success. The results of this plan updated the TSP, including bicycle classifications, recommended bikeway network (including suggested bicycle facilities), and programs to support bicycling.

### Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan, 2009

The Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan identifies potential corridors that will build upon the success of the existing streetcar system and expand service to best serve Portland’s neighborhoods and business districts. The streetcar is a key element in the city’s plan for more sustainable future growth. The results of this plan updated the TSP projects list.

### Freight Master Plan, 2006

The Freight Master Plan identifies capital projects, programs and activities to:

- improve the reliability and efficiency of the freight network to meet increased demands and identify where to invest in system improvements;
- develop strategies for reducing community impacts from freight movement and balance truck movement needs with those of other transportationmodes;
- promote a multi-modal transportation system that supports long-term economic development by recognizing the role of goods delivery in supporting healthy and vibrant mixed-use centers and main streets;

The results of this plan updated the TSP, including freight classifications, freight districts, and
projects.

## Community Involvement Goals

(Comprehensive Plan Chapter 2)

### Community involvement as a partnership

The City of Portland works together as a genuine partner with all Portland communities and
interests. The City promotes, builds, and maintains relationships, and communicates with
individuals, communities, neighborhoods, businesses, organizations, Neighborhood
Associations, Business Associations, institutions, and other governments to ensure meaningful
community involvement in planning and investment decisions. Partnerships with historically
under-served and under-represented communities must be paired with the Cityâ€™s
neighborhood organizations to create a robust and inclusive community involvement system. (
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Goal 2.A)


### Social justice and equity

The City of Portland seeks social justice by expanding choice and opportunity for all community
members, recognizing a special responsibility to identify and engage, as genuine partners,
under-served and under-represented communities in planning, investment, implementation,
and enforcement processes, particularly those with potential to be adversely affected by the
results of decisions. The City actively works to improve its planning and investment-related
decisions to achieve equitable distribution of burdens and benefits and address past injustices.

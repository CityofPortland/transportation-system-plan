## Community Involvement Goals

(Comprehensive Plan Chapter 2)

### Community involvement as a partnership

The City of Portland works together as a genuine partner with all Portland communities and
interests. The City promotes, builds, and maintains relationships, and communicates with
individuals, communities, neighborhoods, businesses, organizations, Neighborhood
Associations, Business Associations, institutions, and other governments to ensure meaningful
community involvement in planning and investment decisions. Partnerships with historically
under-served and under-represented communities must be paired with the Cityâ€™s
neighborhood organizations to create a robust and inclusive community involvement system. (
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Goal 2.A)

### Social justice and equity

The City of Portland seeks social justice by expanding choice and opportunity for all community
members, recognizing a special responsibility to identify and engage, as genuine partners,
under-served and under-represented communities in planning, investment, implementation,
and enforcement processes, particularly those with potential to be adversely affected by the
results of decisions. The City actively works to improve its planning and investment-related
decisions to achieve equitable distribution of burdens and benefits and address past injustices.
(COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Goal 2.B)

### Value community wisdom and participation

Portland values and encourages community and civic participation. The City seeks and
considers community wisdom and diverse cultural perspectives, and integrates them with
technical analysis, to strengthen land use decisions. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Goal 2.C)

### Transparency and accountability

City planning and investment decision-making processes are clear, open, and documented.
Through these processes a diverse range of community interests are heard and balanced. The
City makes it clear to the community who is responsible for making decisions and how community input is taken into account. Accountability includes monitoring and reporting
outcomes. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Goal 2.D)

### Meaningful participation
Community members have meaningful opportunities to participate in and influence all stages
of planning and decision making. Public processes engage the full diversity of affected
community members, including under-served and under-represented individuals and
communities. The City will seek and facilitate the involvement of those potentially affected by
planning and decision making. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Goal 2.E)

### Accessible and effective participation
City planning and investment decision-making processes are designed to be accessible and
effective, and responsive to the needs of all communities and cultures. The City draws from
acknowledged best practices and uses a wide variety of tools, including those developed and
recommended by under-served and under-represented communities, to promote inclusive,
collaborative, culturally-responsive, and robust community involvement. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Goal
2.F)

### Strong civic infrastructure
Civic institutions, organizations, and processes encourage active and meaningful community
involvement and strengthen the capacity of individuals and communities to participate in
planning processes and civic life. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Goal 2.G)

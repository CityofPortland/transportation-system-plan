## Community Involvement Policies

### Partners in decision making
**Partnerships and coordination:** Maintain partnerships and coordinate land use engagement
with:
a. Individual community members. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.1.a)
b. Communities of color (including those whose families have been in this area for
generations such as Native Americans, African Americans, and descendants of
immigrants), low-income populations, Limited English Proficient (LEP) communities,
Native American communities, immigrants and refugees, and other under-served and
under-represented communities. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.1.b)
c. District coalitions, Neighborhood Associations, watershed councils, and business
district associations as local experts and communication channels for place-based
projects. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.1.c)
d. Businesses, unions, employees, and related organizations that reflect Portlandâ€™s
diversity as the center of regional economic and cultural activity. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy
2.1.d)
e. Community-based, faith-based, artistic and cultural, and interest-based non-profits,
organizations, and groups. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.1.e)
f. People experiencing disabilities. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.1.f)
g. Institutions, governments, and Sovereign tribes. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.1.g)

**Broaden partnerships:** : Work with district coalitions, Neighborhood Associations, and business
district associations to increase participation and to help them reflect the diversity of the
people and institutions they serve. Facilitate greater communication and collaboration among
district coalitions, Neighborhood Associations, business district associations, culturally-specific
organizations, and community-based organizations. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.2)

### Environmental justice

**Extend benefits:** Ensure plans and investments promote environmental justice by extending
the community benefits associated with environmental assets, land use, and public investments
to communities of color, low-income populations, and other under-served or underrepresented groups impacted by the decision. Maximize economic, cultural, political, and
environmental benefits through ongoing partnerships. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.3)

**Eliminate burdens:** Ensure plans and investments eliminate associated disproportionate
burdens (e.g. adverse environmental, economic, or community impacts) for communities of
color, low-income populations, and other under-served or under-represented groups impacted
by the decision. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.4)
a. Minimize or mitigate disproportionate burdens in cases where they cannot be
eliminated. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.4.a)
b. Use plans and investments to address disproportionate burdens of previous
decisions. (COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Policy 2.4.b)
c. Provide and document concerted efforts to engage those with the potential to be
impacted by the plans, public policies, or projects in order to evaluate and mitigate
disparate burdens, especially for under-served and under-represented communities
including Limited English Proficient (LEP) communities, communities of color, lowincome populations, and those traditionally underserved by transportation services.

## Introduction

The State Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) defines a refinement plan as an amendment to a Transportation System Plan (TSP) that resolves, at the system level, the function, mode, or general location of a transportation project that was deferred during development of the TSP. A refinement plan is necessary when the detailed information required to address a transportation need could not be determined during the TSP process.

In the context of Portland’s TSP, studies are similar to refinement plans; however, they may not necessarily address a transportation capacity need or their feasibility may not yet be determined. Studies are intended to address issues that have a transportation component identified by the community or other entities.

Metro’s 2018 Regional Transportation System Plan (RTP) identified Mobility Corridors and describes a number of plans and includes a number of studies for Portland to conduct to assist with the implementation of the Mobility Corridors. The City has also identified refinement plans and studies through the Comprehensive Plan update, and TSP process, and area planning. This chapter lists (not in order of priority) the refinement plans and studies that either Metro or the City will undertake over the life of the TSP. In some

## Portland Plans and Studies

### Airport Way & I-205 Transit Study
The Growing Transit Communities Plan found that there is a major transit reliability issue for the westbound Line 87 approaching NE Airport Way & Holman St near I-205. During PM peak times, traffic congestion from the Airport Way to I-205 northbound on-ramp often stretches back to 122nd or beyond, sometimes taking up both lanes. Line 87 buses have a difficult time serving stops in the outer lane and then merging to the center to turn left onto Holman St. PBOT and TriMet would work together to conduct a transit study for this area.

### Broadway Weidler Corridor Plan Update
Update the 1996 Broadway Weidler Corridor Plan and extend the study area so it includes the corridor from the Willamette River to Hollywood Town Center. This will be a comprehensive corridor study assessing the full range of transportation needs and prioritizing solutions.
 
### Brooklyn Neighborhood River Access
Study pedestrian and bike access from the Brooklyn neighborhood to the Willamette River.

### Burnside & 82nd Traffic Circulation Study
The Growing Transit Communities Plan has identified a project concept that would fill the bike lane gap at E. Burnside and 82nd while also improving transit speed and reliability for the Linwe 20. The City proposes to prohibit left turns from Burnside to 82nd, allowing removal of the turn pockets to create more space. Prior to implementation, a traffic circulation study is needed to determine impacts to other adjacent streets and develop mitigation measures if needed. Changes to the intersection at 82nd requires ODOT approval given 82nd is under ODOT jurisdiction.

### West Burnside / Couch Refinement Plan
Enhance West Burnside to improve streetscape quality, multimodal access, and bicycle and pedestrian safety. Explore opportunities for consolidating and/or redeveloping Burnside’s “jug handles” (triangular shaped spaces) into public spaces.

### Citywide Master Street Plans
Complete Master Street Plans for the following districts: Southeast, Far Northeast, North, Northeast, and Northwest. Areas of the City without adopted street plans should be analyzed to determine where adequate connectivity does not exist.

### Central Eastside Railroad Quiet Zone Feasibility Study
Explore the feasibility of implementing a Railroad Quiet Zone along SE 1st Ave.

### Central City Transit Network Study
Study potential improvements to public transportation services along Naito Parkway and the riverfront as development density and activity increases over time. Study the feasibility of consolidating routes and stops on fewer corridors by placing bus lines onto the southern end of the Transit Mall.

### Central City Light Rail Station Study
Work with TriMet to study the feasibility, costs, and benefits of adding new light rail stations and/or consolidating existing stations to improve transit operations and better serve adjacent land uses.

### Central City Transit Capacity Study
Study long-term transit capacity in the Central City, with a focus on high capacity transit, streetcar and Transit Mall operations and identify improvements that enhance long-term system growth, reliability and ease of use.
 
### Central City Truck Loading and Parking Plan
This project will develop a comprehensive truck loading and parking strategy for the Central City to increase efficiency of the on-street loading system, increase compliance with City loading regulations, and balance commercial loading and parking needs with other uses in the public right-of-way. This project will recommend strategies and street design options applicable
to the Central City. This project is funded.

### Clackamas Flexible Street Strategy
Develop a strategy for the NE Clackamas Flexible Street and private development extending from the Rose Quarter to NE 9th Avenue via a new pedestrian/bicycle bridge over I-5.

### Columbia Corridor Access Study
This study would identify priority connectivity needs for all modes along and across the Kenton rail line in Northeast Portland. The study would identify key connectivity needs for all modes, and develop a proposal to work with Union Pacific, other public-sector agencies, and private sector organizations to ensure ongoing connectivity needs are met.

### Cordon Pricing
Study the implementation of a cordon pricing system within Central Portland.

### Cultural District Streetscape Plan
Develop a package of streetscape improvements for the cultural district to enhance the pedestrian experience between attractions including OHS, the Art Museum and the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall.

### Downtown, Goose Hollow, and University District Right of Way Standards
Develop a Right-of-Way standard document for the Downtown, Goose Hollow and University subdistricts to, in part, implement the Street and Development Character Concept for these subdistricts.

### NE Glisan Street Transportation and Streetscape Study
Identify transportation and streetscape improvements that address commercial, pedestrian, bicycle, safety and neighborhood livability needs on NE Glisan between NE 67th and 82nd Avenues.

### Goose Hollow Access and Circulation Plan
Complete a local circulation study for Goose Hollow that explores possible changes to street operations and configurations including one-way vs. two-way streets east of SW 18th, including Jefferson and Columbia; enhanced transit, bicycle facilities and on-street parking to help meet district goals.
 
### Green Loop Concept Plan
Study the feasibility of a connecting network of bicycle and pedestrian ways that creates a new ‘loop’ through Central City. A feasibility study is needed to determine whether bicycle facilities could be constructed in the right-of-way to complete the ‘loop’. The study would need to determine the alignment and whether new facilities or enhancements to existing facilities are needed.

### Hayden Island
In coordination with regional, state and federal partners, develop and evaluate access options to Hayden Island from Marine Drive. Access would include Pedestrian, Bike, Transit, Auto and freight to support the Hayden Island Plan.

### I-205 Bicycle and Pedestrian Overcrossing
Study, conceptual design, stakeholder outreach and project development for a new pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection over I-205 connecting Jade District to Kelly Butte.

### Industrial Lands Access Study
This study will identify, evaluate and prioritize potential industrial lands transportation access investments and revenue sources.

### Interjurisdictional Arterial Improvements Coordination
Develop a coordinated street improvement plan for arterial streets that transcend jurisdictional boundaries. This study would look at streets that cross jurisdictional lines, to identify changes in traffic volumes and traffic origins/destinations and to monitor how the streets’ classifications conform with their function and levels of regional traffic.

### Jefferson Main Street Plan
Develop and implement a strategy to encourage main street streetscape improvements on SW Jefferson Street. Explore the feasibility of burying utilities as part of improvements and planting additional trees.

### Lombard Corridor Transportation and Streetscape Plan
This collaborative study with ODOT will develop a transportation and streetscape plan for N/NE Lombard St from N Woolsey Ave to NE Martin Luther King, Jr Blvd. Areas of focus include pedestrian and bicycle safety and access, transit speed and reliability, traffic management, business district vitality, streetscape environment, freight access, traffic signals and crossings, access management, and parking management. The plan will also include a concept plan and feasibility assessment for reconfiguration of the Lombard/I-5 interchange to improve safety and circulation for all modes.

### Lloyd District Standard Plans and Detail within the Right of Way Update
Update the Lloyd District Standard Plans and Details within the Right-of-Way document to in part implement the Street and Development Character Concept for the district.

### MAX Light Rail Corridor Master Street Plan
Purpose: Complete the master street plan for areas between NE Glisan and SE Stark, east of the Gateway Regional Center. Because the MAX light rail corridor has unique connectivity needs, it was not included in the Far Southeast Street Master Plan study. A higher level of street connectivity is desirable in dense, mixed-use areas to access multiple destinations and disperse vehicle traffic throughout the area. High levels of pedestrian activity also warrant a more densely spaced street grid to facilitate movement and attain high mode split targets for alternatives to single-occupant vehicles.

### Morrison and Hawthorne Bridgeheads Connectivity and Accessibility Study
Study ways to improve multimodal accessibility at the Morrison and Hawthorne bridges.

### Morrison Bridge Eastside Ramps Reconfiguration Study
Study feasibility of realigning the Morrison Bridge off ramp to MLK to allow for through eastbound traffic on Yamhill.

### North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy Update 
Review, update and implement recommendations from the North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy (2009) (includes earlier South Portland Circulation Study Recommendations)

### Northwest District Access and Circulation Study
Prepare an access and circulation study for the NW District neighborhood. Consider street reconfigurations and improvements including pedestrian and bicycle safety and access, travel directions, travel lanes, traffic control, and transit mobility and circulation. Identify and recommend changes to street classifications and identify near-term projects to improve safety, access, and circulation for all modes.

### Projected ODOT “Hot Spot” Locations Refinement Plan
This analysis will identify plan-level solutions for locations with safety and/current or projected capacity problems on or near State Highways. The study refinement plan will also develop and evaluate alternative performance measures, including alternative mobility targets, for State Highways, consistent with Action 1F3 of the Oregon Highway Plan, in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Transportation.

Through modeling and analysis, PBOT and ODOT have identified multiple locations with potential safety and/or projected capacity problems. The agencies have agreed that PBOT will identify feasible actions for addressing these safety and/or capacity programs along with a financially feasible implementation program, the appropriate micro- or meso-scale modeling and analysis tools based on the results of the alternative performance measures work, analyze potential alternative performance measures. After analyzing the locations based on the results of the alternative performance measure work, PBOT will recommend whether and what types of solutions are appropriate for each location for inclusion in the City’s TSP. PBOT will also work with ODOT to develop and recommend alternative State Highway mobility targets for adoption by the City and the Oregon Transportation Commission. This refinement plan will be completed no later than the next major TSP update.

### ODOT District Highways Evaluation
Assess the long-term design and functional needs of state highways inside the city. The city and ODOT are both interested in transitioning district highways within the city limits to Portland’s jurisdiction and management. The city must evaluate the significant cost implications of assuming jurisdiction for these district highways. Many of the highways need reconstruction or are not built to the level of urban standards the City desires. Jurisdiction also includes a long- term responsibility for maintenance and operations.

### Old Town Chinatown Access and Circulation Plan
Prepare a local circulation study for the area north of Burnside. Consider street configurations including travel directions, travel lanes, traffic control, bicycle access and parking, and transit mobility and circulation. Address barriers created by NW Broadway, W Burnside, NW Naito Parkway, the Steel Bridge ramps, Waterfront Park and the railroad tracks.

### University District Access and Circulation Plan
Complete a PSU area access and circulation study that includes multimodal improvements including pedestrian safety; campus loading; drop offs; parking; and bicycle access to and from the campus to adjacent areas, South Waterfront, Goose Hollow and South Portland.

### Salmon Street Concept Plan
Improve Salmon Street as a unique east-west connection linking Washington Park to the Willamette River with landscaping and active transportation facilities. Encourage additional, activating retail.

### Steel Bridge Ramps Reconfiguration Study
Study possible reconfiguration of the Steel Bridge ramps and the rail line to improve pedestrian and bike access to/along the greenway trail, NW Flanders and McCormick Pier and create new development opportunities.

### “The Strand” Concept Plan
Develop the concept for the Strand through Lower Albina. Identified in the N/NE Quadrant plan of the Central City 2035 plan, he Strand is a flexible street connection that meanders through the district.

### US 26 & I-405 Circulation & Safety Study
Complete a study that explores long-term reconfigurations of local and regional connections on and around I-405 between the Ross Island Bridge and Sunset Highway interchanges. Develop conceptual designs for I-405 ramp modifications to improve safety by reducing weaving conflicts and queues on I-405 NB and SB between Marquam Bridge and Sunset Highway, and identify potential funding.

### USPS Site Master Plan
Improve access through the US Postal Service site to Union Station as it redevelops.

### 160's Neighborhood Greenway
Recommend further study, route planning, stakeholder outreach and project development for the 160's Neighborhood Greenway, particularly between SE Division and SE Stark. No route was identified in the Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030 north of SE Division. Currently, there is not a continuous route on existing public right-of-way that connects from SE Division to SE Stark (City Limits). People must travel on 162nd Ave or 174th Ave. A new connection across existing private property or future right-of-way dedication is needed to make this connection on local residential streets or circulate internally between busy arterial streets.

## RTP Corridor Refinement Plans and Studies
The2018 update to the Regional Transportation Plan identifies region-wide planning studies and corridor refinement needs to implement the RTP. The studies and corridor plans listed below specifically identify the city of Portland as a partner. Full project descriptions can be found in the 2018 Regional Transportation Plan.

### Study 8.2.3.7 Central City Transit Capacity and Steel Bridge Analysis
This study would explore ways to alleviate transit operational issues caused by the Steel Bridge.

### Corridor 8.2.4.2 Portland Central City Loop (Mobility Corridor #4)
The purpose of the study is to develop alternative design concepts for Portland Central City Loop.
Improvements to the I-5/405 Freeway Loop must address long-term transportation and land use needs in a system-wide context.

### Corridor 8.2.4 3 Clark County to I-5 via Gateway, Oregon City and Tualatin (Mobility Corridors # 7,8, and 10)
Improvements are needed in this corridor to address existing deficiencies and expected growth in travel in Clark, Multnomah and Clackamas Counties.

### Powell-Division Corridor: Portland Central City to Lents Town Center and Lents Town Center to Gresham Regional Center (Mobility Corridors #19 and #20) 
Anticipated to experience high levels of growth in employment and population by the year 2040, a number of investments are needed in these corridors to address existing deficiencies and serve increased travel demand.
 
### Hillsboro to Portland (Mobility Corridors #13 and #14)
Improvements are needed in this corridor to address existing deficiencies and future growth in freight, commuters, and commercial traffic between Hillsboro’s Silicon Forest, Northern Washington County’s agricultural freight, Portland Central City, and Port of Portland facilities.

## Completed Studies and Plans

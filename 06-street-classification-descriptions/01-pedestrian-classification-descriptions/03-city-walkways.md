### City Walkways

City Walkways are intended to provide safe, convenient, and attractive pedestrian access along major streets and trails with moderate level of pedestrian activity supported by current and planned land uses. These includes Community and Regional Corridors, non-frequent transit lines, and moderate-demand off-street trails.

> **Land Use:** City Walkways should provide access along major streets to neighborhood commercial areas, and other community destinations. Where auto-oriented land uses are allowed on City Walkways, site development standards should address the needs of pedestrians for access.
>
> **Improvements:** City Walkways should have regularly-spaced marked crossings (with closer spacing in Pedestrian Districts), sidewalks on both sides, and a pedestrian realm that can accommodate moderate levels of pedestrian activity.

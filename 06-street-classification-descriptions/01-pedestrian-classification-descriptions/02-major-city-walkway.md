### Major City Walkways

Major City Walkways are intended to provide safe, convenient, and attractive pedestrian access along major streets and trails with a high level of pedestrian activity supported by current and planned land uses. These include Civic and Neighborhood Corridors, Civic and Neighborhood Main Streets, frequent transit lines, high-demand off-street trails, and streets in areas with a high density of pedestrian-oriented uses.

> **Land Use:** Major City Walkways generally serve areas with the highest density of mixed-use zoning, major commercial areas, and major destinations. Where auto-oriented land uses are allowed on Major City Walkways, site development standards should address the needs of pedestrians for access.
>
> **Improvements:** Consider special design treatments for Major City Walkways that are also designated as Civic or Neighborhood Main Streets. Major City Walkways should have regularly-spaced marked crossings (with closer spacing in Pedestrian Districts), wide sidewalks on both sides, and a pedestrian realm that can accommodate high volumes of pedestrian activity.

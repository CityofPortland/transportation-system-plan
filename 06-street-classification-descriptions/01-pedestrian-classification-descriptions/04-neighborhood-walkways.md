### Neighborhood Walkways

Neighborhood Walkways are intended to provide safe and convenient connections from residential neighborhoods to Major City Walkways, City Walkways, and nearby destinations such as schools, parks, transit stops, and commercial areas, primarily using routes that have low levels ofmotor vehicle traffic or do not allow motor vehicle traffic.
>
> **Land Use:** Neighborhood Walkways are usually located in residential or natural areas on  low-volume  Local  Service  Traffic  Streets  or  connections  that  do  not  allow  motor vehicles.
>
> **Improvements:** Neighborhood Walkways should be designed to provide a safe and comfortable walking environment, but may take many forms depending on the context. Design types may include sidewalks, shoulders, shared streets, pedestrian-only paths, multi-use paths, soft-surface trails, and ramps/stairs.

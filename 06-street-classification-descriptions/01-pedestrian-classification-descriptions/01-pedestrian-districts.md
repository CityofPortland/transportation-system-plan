### Pedestrian Districts

Pedestrian Districts are intended to give priority to pedestrian access in areas where high levels of pedestrian activity exist or are planned, including the Central City, Gateway Regional Center, town centers,neighborhood centers,and transit station areas.

> **Land Use:** Zoning should allow a transit-supportive density of residential and commercial uses that support lively and intensive pedestrian activity. Auto-oriented development should be discouraged in Pedestrian Districts. Institutional campuses that generate high levels of pedestrian activity may be included in Pedestrian Districts. Exceptions to the density and zoning criteria may be appropriate in some designated historic districts with a strong pedestrian orientation.
>
> **Streets within a District:** Make walking the mode of choice for all trips within a Pedestrian District. All streets within a Pedestrian District are importantin serving pedestrian trips and should have sidewalks on both sides or meet alternative design criteria.
>
> **Characteristics:** The size and configuration of a Pedestrian District should be consistent with the scale of walking trips. A Pedestrian District includes both sides of the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway. In these instances, the land up to the Regional Trafficway is considered part of the Pedestrian District, but the Regional Trafficway itself is not.
>
> **Access to Transit:** A Pedestrian District should have, or be planned to have, frequent transit service and convenient access to transit stops
>
> **Improvements:** Pedestrian Districts should be designed to provide a safe and comfortable walking environment for high volumes of pedestrians, with a highly-connected and built-out pedestrian network with relatively low levels of delay at signals and other crossings. Major City Walkways and City Walkways within Pedestrian Districts should have closely-spaced marked crossings.

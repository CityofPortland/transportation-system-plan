## Community Involvement
(Comprehensive Plan Chapter 2)

### Goals
**Community involvement as a partnership:** The City of Portland works together as a genuine partner with all Portland communities and interests. The City promotes, builds, and maintains relationships, and communicates with
individuals, communities, neighborhoods, businesses, organizations, Neighborhood
Associations, Business Associations, institutions, and other governments to ensure meaningful
community involvement in planning and investment decisions. Partnerships with historically
under-served and under-represented communities must be paired with the Cityâ€™s
neighborhood organizations to create a robust and inclusive community involvement system. (
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN Goal 2.A)


**Community identity:** Encourage the development of character-giving design features that are responsive to place and the cultures of communities. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.2)
